# Linear-Regression-algorithm

Supervised Learning - Regression
Implement the Linear Regression algorithm from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.

The algorithm must be implemented as a function with arguments, x_train (the features) and y_train (the output).

The Python version to be used must be above 3.5.
